Wether or not use the multi-instance configuration (see [notes](#notes)).

Path of the params file.

####`start`
Should the service be started by Puppet?

Notes
-----

* Version 1.x supported only multi-instances configuration. As we never use this use case, we decided to switch to a single instance configuration.
* Version 1.99.x adds support for single instance configuration but still defaults to multi-instances configuration.
* Version 2.x will default to single instance configuration and deprecate multi-instances configuration.
* Version 3.x will remove multi-instances configuration support.
